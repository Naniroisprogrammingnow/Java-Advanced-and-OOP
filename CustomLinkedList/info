You need to write your own simplified implementation of a generic Linked List which has an Iterator. The list should support the Add and 
Remove operations, should reveal the amount of elements it has with a getSize function and should have an implemented iterator (should be 
foreachable). The add method should add the new element at the end of the collection. The remove method should remove the first occurrence of 
the item starting at the beginning of the collection, if the element is successfully removed the method returns true, alternatively if the 
element passed is not in the collection the method should return false. The getSize method should return the number of elements currently in 
the list. The iterator should iterate over the collection starting from the first entered element.
Input
On the first line of input you will receive a number N. On each of the next N lines you will receive a command in one of the following formats:

•	"Add <number>" - adds a number to your linked list.
•	"Remove <number>" - removes the first occurrence of the number from the linked list. If there is no such element this command leaves the 
collection unchanged.
Output
The output should consist of exactly 2 lines. On the first you should print the result of calling the getSize function on the Linked list. On
the next lines you should print all elements of the collection by calling foreach on the collection.
