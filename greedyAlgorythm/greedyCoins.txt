Write a program, which gathers a sum of money,using the least possible number of coins. This is the range of possible coin values:
•	{ 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50 }
You will receive a desired sum. The goal is to reach the sum using as few coins as possible using a greedy approach.
We’ll assume that each coin value and the desired sum are integers

Exemples:
Coins: 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50
Sum: 923

Coins: 1
Sum: 42

Coins: 3, 7
Sum: 11
